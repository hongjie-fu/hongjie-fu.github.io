Setting: wandering in the campus (under the threat of Covid-19) with my advisor, who was not satisfied with his dinner served. A skater passed by.

my advisor asked me:
>你会玩那个吗？

me (in a humble attitude):
>不会，因为我不是SB。

Of course I am not intended to offend him. As you can tell, we are just strangers. I wont nickname him as "shabi" in Chinese. 
His presence immediately reminded me of a song, *Sk8er Boi*, by Avril Lavigne.
