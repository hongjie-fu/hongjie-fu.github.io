Setting: wandering in the campus (under the threat of Covid-19) with my advisor, who was not satisfied with his dinner served. A skater passed by when we were talking about cats, because we call ourselves cat lovers, or more accurately, quasi-cat-lovers.

Our gaze was directed to that western style skateboarder, then, my advisor asked me:
>你会玩那个吗？

me (in a humble attitude):
>不会，因为我不是SB。

I venture to say that every normal Chinese people (especially in this normal university) who can read some English letters, know SB stands for *shabi* (an idiot) in Chinese. However, I am not intended to offend that skater. As you can tell, we are just strangers. I don't have motivation to discredit him. His presence immediately reminds me of a song, *Sk8er Boi*, by a Canadian singer Avril Lavigne. Therefore, what I want to demonstrate is that I have successfully exploited the ambiguity of meaning of abbreviation to cause certain humorous effect.
